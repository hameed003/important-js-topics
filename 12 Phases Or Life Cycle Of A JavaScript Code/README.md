The **life cycle of a JavaScript code** refers to the sequence of phases that a JavaScript program goes through from the moment it is loaded into the browser or a runtime environment (like Node.js) until it finishes execution. Understanding the life cycle is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code. Below, I'll explain the different phases of a JavaScript code's life cycle in detail, with examples.

## **Phases of JavaScript Code Life Cycle**

### **1. Parsing Phase**

In this phase, the JavaScript engine parses the code and converts it into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**. The AST is a tree-like representation of the code's structure, which the engine uses to understand the program.

#### **What Happens During Parsing?**

- The engine reads the code line by line.
- It checks for syntax errors (e.g., missing brackets, invalid keywords).
- It builds the AST.

#### **Example**

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

During parsing, the engine creates an AST for this function, representing its structure (e.g., function name, parameters, body).

---

### **2. Compilation Phase**

Modern JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome) use **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation. In this phase:

- The engine converts the AST into **bytecode** or **machine code**.
- The code is optimized for execution.

#### **What Happens During Compilation?**

- The engine identifies frequently executed code (hot code) and optimizes it.
- It performs optimizations like **inlining** (replacing function calls with the function body) and **dead code elimination** (removing unused code).

#### **Example**

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
```

The engine compiles the `add` function into machine code for faster execution.

---

### **3. Execution Phase**

In this phase, the compiled code is executed. The JavaScript engine uses the **call stack** to manage function calls and the **memory heap** to store objects and variables.

#### **What Happens During Execution?**

- The engine creates a **global execution context**.
- It executes the code line by line.
- Functions are pushed onto the call stack when called and popped off when they return.

#### **Example**

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("Alice"); // Hello, Alice!
```

During execution:

1. The `greet` function is called.
2. It is pushed onto the call stack.
3. The `console.log` statement is executed.
4. The function is popped off the call stack.

---

### **4. Memory Allocation and Garbage Collection**

JavaScript automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation. The **memory heap** is used to store objects and variables, while the **garbage collector** reclaims memory that is no longer in use.

#### **What Happens During Memory Allocation?**

- Variables and objects are allocated memory in the heap.
- Primitive values (e.g., numbers, strings) are stored directly, while objects are stored as references.

#### **What Happens During Garbage Collection?**

- The garbage collector identifies and frees memory that is no longer reachable.
- It uses algorithms like **mark-and-sweep** to determine unreachable objects.

#### **Example**

```javascript
let obj = { name: "Alice" }; // Memory allocated for the object
obj = null; // Object is no longer reachable and will be garbage collected
```

---

### **5. Event Loop and Asynchronous Execution**

JavaScript is single-threaded but supports asynchronous execution using the **event loop**. The event loop handles asynchronous tasks like timers, network requests, and user interactions.

#### **What Happens in the Event Loop?**

- Synchronous code is executed first.
- Asynchronous tasks are pushed to the **callback queue** or **microtask queue**.
- The event loop continuously checks the call stack and queues, executing callbacks when the stack is empty.

#### **Example**

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise");
});

console.log("End");

// Output:
// Start
// End
// Promise
// Timeout
```

Explanation:

1. Synchronous code (`console.log("Start")` and `console.log("End")`) is executed first.
2. The `Promise` callback is added to the **microtask queue** and executed before the `setTimeout` callback.
3. The `setTimeout` callback is added to the **callback queue** and executed last.

---

### **6. Termination Phase**

When the program finishes execution, the JavaScript engine cleans up resources and terminates the process.

#### **What Happens During Termination?**

- The global execution context is destroyed.
- Memory allocated during execution is freed.
- The program exits.

#### **Example**

```javascript
console.log("Program started");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Program finished");
}, 1000);
```

After 1 second, the program prints "Program finished" and terminates.

## **Detailed Example: Life Cycle of a JavaScript Program**

```javascript
// Parsing Phase: The engine parses the code and builds an AST.
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched");
    }, 1000);
  });
}

// Compilation Phase: The engine compiles the code into machine code.
async function main() {
  console.log("Start");

  // Execution Phase: The code is executed line by line.
  const data = await fetchData();
  console.log(data);

  console.log("End");
}

main();

// Event Loop: Handles asynchronous tasks.
// Output:
// Start
// Data fetched (after 1 second)
// End
```
