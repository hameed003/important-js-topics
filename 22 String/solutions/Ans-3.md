Great question! **Reassignment of a variable** is different from **mutability**. Let me explain the distinction clearly:

---

## **Reassignment vs. Mutability**

### **1. Reassignment**

Reassignment refers to changing the **value stored in a variable**. This does not change the original value itself; it simply points the variable to a new value.

#### **Example**

```javascript
let x = 5; // x holds the value 5
x = 10; // x now holds the value 10
```

Here, the variable `x` is reassigned to a new value (`10`). The original value (`5`) is not changed; it still exists in memory (unless garbage collected).

---

### **2. Mutability**

Mutability refers to whether the **value itself** can be changed after it is created. If a value is **mutable**, it can be modified in place. If it is **immutable**, it cannot be changed; any operation that appears to modify it creates a **new value**.

#### **Example with a Mutable Object**

```javascript
const obj = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
obj.age = 30; // The object is mutated in place
console.log(obj); // { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
```

Here, the object itself is modified. The variable `obj` still points to the same object, but the object's properties have changed.

#### **Example with an Immutable String**

```javascript
let str = "hello";
str = str + " world"; // A new string is created
console.log(str); // "hello world"
```

Here, the original string (`"hello"`) is not modified. Instead, a new string (`"hello world"`) is created, and the variable `str` is reassigned to point to this new string.

## **Key Differences**

| Feature          | Reassignment                                       | Mutability                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**   | Changing the value a variable points to.           | Changing the value itself in memory. |
| **Example**      | `let x = 5; x = 10;`                               | `const obj = {}; obj.prop = 1;`      |
| **Effect**       | Variable points to a new value.                    | The original value is modified.      |
| **Immutability** | Reassignment is allowed even for immutable values. | Immutable values cannot be changed.  |

## **Reassignment with Immutable Values**

Even though a value is immutable, you can still **reassign a variable** to point to a new value. This does not change the original value; it simply changes what the variable references.

### **Example with Strings**

```javascript
let str = "hello"; // str points to "hello"
str = "world"; // str now points to "world"
```

Here, the original string (`"hello"`) is not modified. The variable `str` is simply reassigned to point to a new string (`"world"`).

---

## **Reassignment with Mutable Values**

For mutable values (like objects or arrays), reassignment can either:

1. Point the variable to a new value, or
2. Modify the original value in place.

### **Example with Objects**

```javascript
const obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
const obj2 = obj1; // obj2 points to the same object as obj1

obj2.name = "Bob"; // The object is mutated in place
console.log(obj1); // { name: "Bob" } (original object is modified)

obj2 = { name: "Charlie" }; // Error: Cannot reassign a const variable
```

Here:

- `obj2.name = "Bob"` mutates the original object.
- Reassigning `obj2` to a new object is not allowed because `obj2` is declared with `const`.

---

## **Immutability in Practice**

### **1. Immutable Values**

Immutable values (like strings, numbers, booleans, etc.) cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify them creates a new value.

#### **Example**

```javascript
let num = 5;
num = num + 1; // Creates a new number (6)
console.log(num); // 6
```

### **2. Mutable Values**

Mutable values (like objects and arrays) can be changed in place.

#### **Example**

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Modifies the original array
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

## **Summary**

- **Reassignment** is about changing what a variable points to. It does not change the original value.
- **Mutability** is about whether the original value itself can be changed.
- Immutable values (like strings, numbers, booleans, etc.) cannot be changed. Reassignment creates a new value.
- Mutable values (like objects and arrays) can be changed in place. Reassignment can either point to a new value or modify the original value.

Understanding the difference between reassignment and mutability is crucial for writing predictable and efficient JavaScript code.
